      "I had excellent experience with Four Paws Cat Boarding. I left my cat for 6 days with them and they took care of him as their own child. I didnâ€™t even have to worry about anything while my cat was with them. They sent me pictures and videos regularly every day and gave my cat a home-like environment. Will be sending my cat here only whenever in need.",
